Palindrome Checker

You're building a word game that awards bonus points for palindromes.
Given a string, determine if it reads the same forwards and backwards,
ignoring case and non-alphanumeric characters.

Example 1:
    Input: text = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
    Output: True
    Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome

Example 2:
    Input: text = "race a car"
    Output: False
    Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome

Example 3:
    Input: text = " "
    Output: True
    Explanation: Empty after removing non-alphanumeric

Constraints:
    - Input is always a string
    - Ignore spaces, punctuation, and case
    - Empty string is considered a palindrome
